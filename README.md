## Form Handling in PHP.
In this tiny project, I create a simple form where the user can enter their name, email address and gender. The form is then validated using various PHP form validation functions including:<br>
*htmlspecialchars() to convert special characters to html entities which are harmless thus preventing cross side scripting attacks.
*trim() to strip unnecessary spaces, tabs and new lines.
*stripslashes() to remove backslashes.
<br>
The fields are also validated using regular expressions before finally being submitted.
